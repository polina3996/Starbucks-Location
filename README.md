<h>Starbucks Location Data Analysis</h>

In this analysis I train a skill of geocoding, creating interactive maps and joining datasets.

<h>Data</h>

I had the next data for my project:
- CSV-file with Starbucks locations in the state of California
- SHP-file with counties of California
- CSV-file with estimate of the population of each county
- CSV-file with the number of households with an income of at least $150,000 per year
- CSV-file with the median age for each county.

<h>Task</h>

I as a Starbucks big data analyst am looking to find the next store into a Starbucks Reserve Roastery. These roasteries are much larger than a typical Starbucks store and have several additional features, including various food and wine options, along with upscale lounge areas. I'll investigate the demographics of various counties in the state of California, to determine potentially suitable locations.
